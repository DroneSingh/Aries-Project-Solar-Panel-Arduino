# Aries-Project-Solar-Panel-Arduino
To increase the efficiency of solar panels to absorb more of solar intensity to generate more energy we have deviced a mechanism of 2 degree of freedom movement of the solar panel so that it becomes perpendicular to the direction of light as that helps to absorb the maximum flux thus increasing efficiency.
